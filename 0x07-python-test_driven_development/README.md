# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Overview

This project is focused on implementing test-driven development (TDD) practices in Python. Test-driven development is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. It promotes a systematic and disciplined approach to building robust and maintainable software.

## Introduction

Test-driven development involves the following key steps:

1. **Write a Test:** Start by writing a test that describes a small piece of functionality.
2. **Run the Test:** Confirm that the test fails, indicating that the functionality is not implemented yet.
3. **Write Code:** Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
4. **Run Tests:** Execute all tests to ensure that the newly added code didn't break existing functionality.
5. **Refactor Code:** If needed, refactor the code for better design while keeping the tests passing.

## Project Structure

```
/your_project
|-- README.md
|-- tests
|   |-- test_module.py
|-- your_module.py
```

- `tests`: Directory containing test modules.
- `test_module.py`: Test file(s) for your module(s).
- `your_module.py`: Your Python module(s) with the actual code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your_project
   ```

## Running Tests

Execute tests using your preferred testing framework:

- For `unittest`:

  ```bash
  python -m unittest discover tests
  ```

- For `pytest`:

  ```bash
  pytest tests
  ```

## Testing Frameworks

This project supports both `unittest` and `pytest` testing frameworks. Choose the one that aligns with your preferences.

## Common Testing Flags

Explore common testing flags for `unittest` and `pytest` in the [Testing Flags](#common-testing-flags) section of the documentation.

## Best Practices

- Write descriptive test names for clarity.
- Keep tests independent and isolated.
- Regularly run the entire test suite.
- Aim for high test coverage to ensure code reliability.
