# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Introduction

This README provides an overview of two fundamental data structures in Python: Lists and Tuples.

## Lists

### Definition

A list is a mutable, ordered collection of elements. Lists can store various data types and allow for dynamic modifications.

### Key Operations

- **Accessing Elements**: Retrieve elements using index.
- **Modifying Elements**: Update elements at specific positions.
- **Adding Elements**: Append or insert elements.
- **Removing Elements**: Delete elements by value or index.
- **Iteration**: Traverse through the list.

## Tuples

### Definition

A tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of elements. Once defined, a tuple cannot be modified, making it suitable for storing constant data.

### Key Characteristics

- **Immutability**: Elements cannot be changed after creation.
- **Ordered Structure**: Maintains order of elements.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Requires less memory compared to lists.

## Conclusion

Understanding the distinctions between lists and tuples is essential for effective Python programming. Lists provide flexibility with mutability, while tuples offer immutability for constant data.

For a detailed understanding and advanced operations, refer to the official Python documentation on [Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) and [Tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences).
