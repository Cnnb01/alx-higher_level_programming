# Python - Everything is Object

## Introduction

This repository explores the concept of "Everything is Object" in Python. Python is known for its object-oriented programming paradigm, where everything in the language is treated as an object.

## What is an Object?

In Python, an object is a self-contained unit that consists of data and the functions that operate on that data. Objects are instances of classes, and Python is designed to be a truly object-oriented language.

## Key Concepts

1. **Everything is an Object:** In Python, every value is an object, and every operation is a method call. Whether it's a number, string, function, or even a module, everything is an object with its own properties and methods.

2. **Objects have Types:** Each object in Python has a type that defines its behavior. Types determine what operations are allowed on an object and how they behave.

3. **Mutability vs. Immutability:** Some objects, like numbers and strings, are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed after creation. Others, like lists and dictionaries, are mutable and can be modified.

4. **Variables are References:** When you assign a value to a variable, you're actually creating a reference to the object. Understanding this reference concept is crucial in Python.

5. **Object Identity:** Every object in Python has a unique identity. The `id()` function can be used to get the identity of an object.

## Examples

```python
# Numbers are objects
x = 10
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>

# Strings are objects
message = "Hello, Python!"
print(type(message))  # <class 'str'>

# Functions are objects
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

print(type(greet))  # <class 'function'>

# Lists are objects
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(type(numbers))  # <class 'list'>
```
